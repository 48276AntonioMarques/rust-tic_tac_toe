# [Rust] Tic Tac Toe

## Introduction
This is a little project created with the purpose of helping me to learn rust.
It started as a Terminal/Text User Interface here the game would render, then was improved using ANSI.
Currently, the purpose of this project is to have a full Graphical User Interface using [the iced library](https://iced.rs//).

## TUI / Nostalgia
If you are interested in anything related to the Terminal User Interface, check out the repo until [this commit](4dca648).
Don't want tou compile it? Until [version 1.+](https://github.com/48276AntonioMarques/rust-tic_tac_toe/releases/tag/1.1.1) the executables use the text UI.

## Objective
Have a User Interface in which is possible to play tic-tac-toe locally against yourself or a friend using the same computer.
